### Instructions:
There are two places where it says "TODO" in the code. You need to complete the code at those places.
1. In the COVIDData class, write the Comparable interface method for the class that compares the number of __confirmed__ cases.
2. In the covid.java class, create a COVIDData object named data that is based on each line of the dataset.
3. In the covid.java class, sort the data in ascending order of confirmed cases.
